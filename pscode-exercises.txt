// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd


  If number is totally divisible by 2
       number = even
  Else number is not totally divisable by 2
       Number = odd
     
         
 


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)      Read (num1, num2, num3, num4, and num5

b)      find the total sum of 
           num1
           num2
           num3
           num 4
           num5
           
              
        divide  the sum of all 5 numbers by 5
           total numbers added and divided = avrage of 5 the 5 numbers


              loop 1
c)    find  smalest minimum number

        If num1 < num2
           num2 = smallest number

        If num2 < num3
           num2 = smallest number
 
        If num2 > num4
           num4 = smallest number

        If num4 < num5
           num4 = smallest mininmum number

               loop 2    
      find largest maximum number

        If num1 > num2
           num1 = largest num

        If num1 > num3
           num1 largest number
         
        If num1 > num4
           num1 = largest number

        If num1 < num5
           num5 = largest maximum number

d) I averaged the 5 numbers 

then attempted a loop to find the smallest minimum number

I also attempted a loopto find the largest maximim number
